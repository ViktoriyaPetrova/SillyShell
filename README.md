This program creates a Unix shell that is capable of executing commands in the background 
and in the foreground. It is also capable of handling the built it command "exit" which
causes the program to terminate. The program will wait for all children processes to be
done executing prior to terminating. It cannot handle any built in commands other than "exit" 
as of right now.
